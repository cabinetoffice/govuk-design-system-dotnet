# How to Contribute

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Suggesting a new feature
- Contributing an update or fix


## Reporting a bug
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. You can report a bug by opening a new issue.

Before creating bug reports, please check the issues list as you might find that one already exists for that bug. When you are creating an issue for a bug, please include as many details as possible and add a `bug` label. Try to include:

- A quick summary and any background information
- Steps to reproduce the issue. Be specific and give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens


## Suggesting a new feature

We also use GitHub issues to track new feature requests. Please tag these issues with an `enhancement` label.

##  Contributing an update or fix

We actively welcome pull requests. The best way to contribute is to:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make your changes.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, please add tests and ensure the test suite passes.
4. Issue a pull request
